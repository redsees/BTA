Better than all assembler ,is an open-source assembler made on GNU Linux ,to assemble SIC/XE assembly instructions .

It takes a normal text file that contains SIC/XE instructions as an input ,processes and assembles them ,then outputs the real world generated Object code file written in a simple ,yet interactive Hexadecimal bytes patterns .


This made it easy for non-technical/engineer students to learn ,write and execute SIC/XE binary files with an easy way to assemble them .


It also contains an interactive multi-error-displaying functionality ,that can handle a lot of different kind of errors with a simple and informational documentation for the error ,not only official usual known errors are handled ,also ,errors that most non-technical students are tricked at ,such as working on a specific coding format ,or loading a non-SIC file by wrong ,etc... 

All of these and more are to be discussed later in the coming sections .

BTA uses Hash table data structure to maintain ,manipulate as well as procesing data ,so that all of these operations becomes the fastest possible because of the Hash table access time ( O(1) ) .
